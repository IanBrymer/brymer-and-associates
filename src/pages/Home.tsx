Good management of the construction process is pivotal to delivering a superior end product. A close working relationship and constant communication between Ian, Merinda and the client facilitate the accurate portrayal of the architect’s and client’s vision to the construction management team. Details like choosing the right builders for the project, specifying the correct materials, managing the installation of the technical elements and minimising drawing interpretation errors all go a long way to delivering a great building that will be well used for many years. Strong emphasis is also placed on finishing details like landscaping, interior design and detailing, joinery and help with soft finishing. The quality of the construction team is a very important element, as many members of the team will develop long term relationships with the client.</p></Col>
